License
----
It is important to always read the license for every font that you use. Each
font family directory contains the appropriate license file for the fonts in
that directory. The fonts files themselves also contain licensing and authorship
metadata.

Most of the fonts in the collection use the SIL Open Font License, v1.1. Some
fonts use the Apache 2 license. The Ubuntu fonts use the Ubuntu Font License
v1.0.

The SIL Open Font License has an option for copyright holders to include a
Reserved Font Name requirement, and this option is used with some of the fonts.
If you modify those fonts, please take care of this important detail.
