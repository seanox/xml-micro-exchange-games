# Description
Proof of concept for small multiplayer games based on [aspect-js](
    https://github.com/seanox/aspect-js) and [xml-micro-exchange](
    https://github.com/seanox/xml-micro-exchange-js).

It will probably be a long-term project where it is not yet clear when and if
there will be a release. The project is driven by personal interest, since our
beloved online rummy has become so bad.

Since we do not own the rights to the required cards, we use free sources as a
substitute. which can be customized.
